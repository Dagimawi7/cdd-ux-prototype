# Cambridge CDD UX Prototype

## Overview
This project is a modern redesign of the Cambridge Community Development Department (CDD) website. The goal was to take a complex government site and make it **easy, accessible, and friendly** for all residents.

Instead of confusing menus and jargon, this prototype organizes everything by what users actually want to do—finding housing, getting permits, or checking zoning maps.

## Key Improvements
*   **User-Centric Design:** Navigation is built around tasks (Housing, Permits, Zoning) rather than internal departments.
*   **Interactive Maps:** A fully interactive zoning map replaces static PDFs, making it easier to explore the city.
*   **Accessible & Clear:** We used high-contrast colors, clear fonts, and "plain language" to ensure everyone can use the site.
*   **Mobile First:** The design works perfectly on phones, featuring a responsive menu and touch-friendly buttons.
*   **Instant Search:** A prominent search bar allows users to jump straight to what they need.
*   **Fast Performance:** The site is optimized to load quickly, respecting the user's time.

## Technologies Used
*   **React:** For a snappy, dynamic user interface.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For beautiful, custom styling without the bloat.
*   **Leaflet Maps:** For the interactive zoning experience.
*   **Vite:** For lightning-fast development and building.
